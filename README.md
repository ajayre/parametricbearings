# Parametric Bearings
3D printed parametric bearings for Alibre Design that uses cheap BBs.

Ported from the Fusion 360 version by RoTechnic. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YIZaJnER_k and https://github.com/roTechnic/3DPrintedBearings

Tested with 4.5mm BBs (Crosman Copperhead)

Example: create a custom sized bearing with 12 balls; total cost is $0.21 for plastic, $0.06 for balls = $0.28.
